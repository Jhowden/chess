##Chess
To run the tests, simply type:
<code>rspec</code>

To play the game, simply type:
<code>ruby lib/play_game</code>

###Things to note
Please not the while you can currently play the game, I have not yet implemented a way for the game to determine checkmate and end on a winning condition.
It is currently a work in progress and the work can be seen in the Checkmate file in the lib directory.

Furthermore, if you try to select a cell that has no piece on it, the game will throw an exception and exit out. Do not do this.

Also, if you do not put the input in the correct way (b3 b4). the game will throw an exception and exit out. Do not do this as well.

This is a work in progress and still has a ways to go, but feel free to submit feedback.
